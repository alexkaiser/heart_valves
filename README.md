# Project Title

Mitral Valve

## Getting Started

Repo for code associated with Modeling the Mitral Valve. 

See https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00018 for preprint, https://search.proquest.com/docview/1966554975 for thesis. 

Run valve_generator/generate_valve.m to build model valves. 

Write to me for additional instructions. This repo was written with the intention of my personal use, but I will clean code and write manuals if interest is expressed. 

### Prerequisites

The fluid solver used is IBAMR. 

Customizations are in the following branch: https://github.com/alexkaiser/IBAMR/tree/prescribed_motion
